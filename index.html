							<h2 class="major">Our Story</h2>
							During our second year of graduate school, we met serendipitously in Caroline's advisor's office while discussing our teaching assistant duties for the upcoming semester. Greg had just transfered to Princeton after a year at Duke, and was assigned to co-TA (with Caroline) for a Computer Science class at Princeton that Caroline's advisor happened to be teaching. While we didn't know it at the time, that meeting turned out to be our first date&mdash;Caroline's advisor told her two years later that she had sensed some magic in the office that day (or at least much more than is usually present in Computer Science offices). Later that afternoon, we had our second date at a cafeteria in Princeton. There, we divided up our TA duties, discussed CrossFit and Vitamix blenders, and Caroline decided that Greg wasn't going to be so terrible to work with after all.
							<p>
							<p>
							The first date that we were cognizant of was at a local pizza place/dive bar (Conte's) where we watched the Jets lose. Greg's credit card got fake-declined by a witty waitress, and he thought that was the end. Thankfully for us, it wasn't the end. We've been inseparable since, and yes, we've been back to Conte's but also enjoy the occasional natural wine bar in Paris.
							<p>
							<p>
							Our love for food is obvious, and fittingly, Greg proposed to Caroline at 4 Charles Prime Rib in New York City. We had been to this characteristically-New-York 20's-style underground steakhouse before, but the previous time, Caroline was 24 hours away from getting diagnosed with both the A and B strains of the flu. She had just returned from China the day before (thanks, kids on planes)! So since then, we were determined to go back to 4 Charles and get the sundae we hadn't survived to see the first time. Before dessert, Greg got down on one knee, professed his love (with some unrepeatably nerdy and overly loquacious utterances), and we've been forever-baes<sup>1</sup> since. We still haven't made it through the sundae.
							<p>

								<div style="color:pink ! important; font-size: 16px">
								1 Caroline coined this term. Sort of. It's like bae (before anyone else/boo/boyfriend or girlfriend), but the forever kind, so for life.
